/*
Given a row-wise sorted 2D matrix mat[][] of size n x m and an integer x, find whether element x is present in the matrix.
Note: In a row-wise sorted matrix, each row is sorted in itself, i.e. for any i, j within bounds, mat[i][j] <= mat[i][j+1].

Examples :

Input: mat[][] = [[3, 4, 9],[2, 5, 6],[9, 25, 27]], x = 9
Output: true
Explanation: 9 is present in the matrix, so the output is true.

Input: mat[][] = [[19, 22, 27, 38, 55, 67]], x = 56
Output: false
Explanation: 56 is not present in the matrix, so the output is false.

Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 9],[65, 69, 75]], x = 91
Output: false
Explanation: 91 is not present in the matrix.
